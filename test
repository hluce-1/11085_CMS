sorry im taking so long to reply, I had to finsih the work I was doing 


alright, for starters, im really 

um okay so yeah so ive brefly told you that I have had issues with food and weight and as much as i 
am doing a lot better than what I was during the time of that photo for example I still have a lot of issues with self hatred 
and the commends about eating something wrong and it automatically making you fat can kind of be really triggering and unhelpful.

like I obviously have tried healhting eating and exercinging but its never been something ive been able to safely 

and consequently im fat and gross but im trying to be okay with it - i have a coule of issues with mebntal healthy but i try not to get into it becuase its not your things do put up with - 

if you could try and reduce the amount of fat comments 



I was trying to tell you, you are really beautiful, honeslty, I don't want you to change or doubt anything about you, I knew when you go queit 
that I should have riterated that better for you, but im dumb and need time to articulate things like that 


like me saying im getting fat when I eat is meant to be in jest 

-ive been told my whole life that I need to put on weight, which is very hard for me to do, but It doesnt bother me as it does you
but it doesnt being told this stuff doenst affected me as it does you 

- I really dont want to have this convo over messenger but I you're busy all week, so anyway 
the only reason why I suggest to litterally anyone, and I have this convo with my mum all the time 

is that eating healthy and exercising is the only way myself and friends have been able to get better both mentally and physically 
it sucks here and there but it makes you happy and healthy eventully 

- I'm glad youre letting me know, you have to tell me when im being an idiot - otherwise ill say and do things
that I otherwise should avoid 

when I said I was concerned about the photo, it was becuase of those black spots, I thought thats on your skin? not from the mirror? 

Its not a matter of sinigning up for anything, I have my own problems and I'm not helping myself by soughting them out, but im trying where I can 

I obvoiusly wanted to talk about this sooner, but I was on a time constraint to get that work done
